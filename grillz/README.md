Code for "GRILLZ," to be completed in September 2014.

"Grillz" is an exploration and analysis of the roles that poverty and wealth play in mainstream hip-hop lyricism. Song lyrics are examined for explicit references to both extreme poverty and extreme wealth and scored according to relative distance from each other. A landscape is created from the scores, which are then extruded into a 3D shape and printed into wearable grillz.

Using Ricard Marxer's [Geomerative](http://www.ricardmarxer.com/geomerative/) library and Marius Watz' [ModelBuilder](https://github.com/mariuswatz/modelbuilderMk2) library for Processing, and my own [PyGenius](http://github.com/rouxpz/pygenius) module for Python.
